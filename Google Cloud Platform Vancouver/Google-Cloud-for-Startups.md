### Google Cloud for Startups Overview
---
1. Most common issues startups face when it comes to the cloud.
2. What tools and technologies can be used to solve those issues.
3. Using GCP.

4 factors startups/tech companies look for in cloud solutions: 
- Faster Development - get to the market asap, sell product make money, less spending on development stage.
- Cheaper Solutions - every $ counts.
- Higher Scalability - need a scalable platform that allows growth, how can we scale our operation on the cloud.
- Cloud Agnostic - don't be tied down to a platform, can have hybrid solutions in case one provider goes down.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Started in 2008, App Engines. 
- Built on Google's core infrastructure, private and biggest network in the world.
- GCP is commited to open source. 
  - Kubernetes, Tensorflow, CloudSpanner -> can build on GCP but not be tied on GCP.
- Well priced, 60% cheaper than other providers, per minute billing, committed use up to 57% discounts.
  - Cloud credits scales based on funding e.g. Series A level funding: get $20K to $100K free GCP credits, Snapchat saved a lot of money.
- Good support and resources, can directly talk with Google's engineers if there are problems.

GCP Services
- Compute, Storage/DBs, Networking - these 3 are essential for any cloud platform.
  - Compute: App Engine (PaaS) - you code, you deploy, they manage everything.
  - Storage/DBs: Cloud storage, Cloud SQL
   - Networking: Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN 
- Big Data, IoT, Machine Learning - differentiators of GCP. No other platforms have the same extent.
  - Out of the box: can just make calls to Cloud APIs for NLP, speech, translation, vision, video intelligence
- Management tools
  - Stackdriver, monitor/logging, debugger on the cloud, cloud deployment manager
