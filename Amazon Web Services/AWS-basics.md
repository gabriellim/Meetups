## Amazon Web Services

### Getting started with AWS
---
Menu > AWS & Cloud Computing > Global Infrastructure
- Each orange circle is a region/data centre owned and operated by AWS. For Vancouver, we can use US West (Oregon).
- Multiple availability zones in each region meaning if one zone goes down, the other can balance the load. Produces high uptime for global customers.
- Register for an account to use AWS Free Tier, includes offers that expire 12 months after signing up and some that will never expire.
- AWS has pay-as-you-go services.
- If you stay within the boundaries of Free Tier then you won't be charged.
- Go to https://aws.amazon.com/free/ for more details.
- Non-expiring offers include AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, CodeCommit, CloudWatch, Mobile Analytics and more.
- Expiring offers include AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic File System (EFS), Relational Database Service (RDS), AWS IoT and more.

### What is Cloud Computing?
- It's an on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, apps and It resources through the cloud platform and Internet. Priced as pay-as-you-go.

### Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2)
---
- EC2 lets you start virtual servers where you define how powerful they are. You can then do anything you want on them. Install web server and php interpreter and host your own website.
