### Traditional vs Serverless Web Hosting
---
### Traditional Hosting
- Capacity: You manage the physical server, limited resources since you define how much CPU, RAM, memory.
- Scaling: Bad, could pay too much for what you actually need or server can breakdown.
- Updates/Security: Have to update the OS and security software yourself.
- Overhead: A lot of overhead for SPA + API apps, awesome for fullstack apps.

### Serverless Hosting
- Capacity: Unlimited capacity since AWS manages the actual server hardware for you, request resources as much or as little as you want.
- Scaling: Good, scales automatically since you only have to pay for what you use.
- Updates/Security: AWS handles everything for you.
- Overhead: Good for SPA + API apps, limited for fullstack apps.
