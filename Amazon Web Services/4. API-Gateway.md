## Amazon Web Services

### API Gateway
---
How It Works
- Have a web app, mobile app or client like Postman -> Send request to a REST API to get or post data -> Can trigger actions when requests come in -> Directly access other AWS services e.g. Run Lambda Code
- Using API Gateway:
  - Can define API endpoints, resources and HTTP Methods
  - Handle authentication so only users from your app can fetch from the API
