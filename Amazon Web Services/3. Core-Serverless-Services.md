---
**1. Serve a static app (Angular or React) -> S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
- Static app is has a couple of files, html and scripts
- No need to run server side code, simply store the files and configure how to access from the web

**2. If we need a REST API -> API Gateway**
- Store or fetch data

**3. Execute code on demand -> Lambda**
- Run code whenever it is needed

**4. Store and retrieve data in a DB -> DynamoDB (NoSQL)**
- Don't have to provision any DB server

**5. Authenticate Users -> Cognito**
- Create user pools to allows users to sign up and log in to use our services
- Can protect REST API so only authenticated users can access its endpoints

**6. Translate URL -> Route 53**
- Register and configure our own domain, load from our S3 file bucket

**7. Improve Performance (e.g. caching) -> Cloudfront**
- Will copy static files in S3 to different content delivery networks (CDNs) around the world so users will have the quickest route when accessing your resources
